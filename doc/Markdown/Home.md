## Welcome to Dexter Blog Engine ##

**[Dexter](http://dexterblogengine.com "Dexter Blog Engine Official Web Site")** is a free and open source project totally developed with Microsoft technologies release under [Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)](https://github.com/imperugo/Dexter-Blog-Engine/wiki/License).

### History ###

It’s born as a technology demo but it has evolved in time thanks to the community feedback and support to become a powerful blog engine.
The original goal of the project was to create a case study for a MVC implementation (the idea of Dexter was born when ASP.NET MVC was not yet released), so the founder [Ugo Lattanzi](http://www.tostring.it "Ugo Lattanzi's Blog") created the project and afterwards some of the most important Italian developers started to use it and to contribute.

### Features ###

Actually, Dexter supports most of the top features required by a blog engine, like:

- **Categories** and **Tags** (with the capability to assign multiple categories to a single post);
- **Comments**;
- **Trackback**;
- **Pingback**;
- **Scheduling** async activities like disable comment, backup, antispam and `whatever you want`;
- Complete integration with **Windows Live Writer**, not only for publishing posts but also for creating pages (for example, the About or the Contact page).
- Internal and very powerful **search engine** with 
`related posts`, `Did u mean` and `highlight`;
- **RSS feed**;
- **Mail notifications**;
- Support to **feedburner**;
- Support for **Plugin**;
- **Plugin Store** with support for versioning;
- **Users** and **Roles**;
- **Dynamic Pages** is like a small CMS. You can create your own pages from Backoffice or directly by Windows Live Writer;


### Some tech stuff ###

The current release features some of the latest and powerful technologies of the .NET world: it’s built using the .NET framework 4.5 with a set of open source libraries like **RavenDB**, **Castle Windsor**, **Quartz.NET**, **NuGet** etc and it’s focused on extendibility and simplicity.
